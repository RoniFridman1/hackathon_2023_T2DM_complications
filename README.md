# hackathon_2023_T2DM_complications
Hackathon in which the goal was finding solutions for complications arising from type 2 diabetes.
We created a framework in which you train a model for a binary task, and then created an application to find the minimum amount of effort patients need to make in order to be classified outside the "danger zone" in a robust way (Robust Optimization).
For data exploration, open *Exploration.html* and *Model.html*.
For model Architecture visit *Presentation* folder.
